# Explain Different Stages Involved in NLP with suitable examples

Sure! Here's a table explaining the stages in NLP with examples:

| Stage                | Description                                                | Example                                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lexical Analysis     | Analysis of individual words or tokens in a sentence.       | Sentence: "I love to eat pizza."                          |
|                      | It involves tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging. | Tokens: ["I", "love", "to", "eat", "pizza", "."]         |
|                      |                                                            | POS Tags: [PRON, VERB, PART, VERB, NOUN, PUNCT]           |
| Syntactic Analysis   | Analysis of the sentence structure and grammar.             | Sentence: "She sings beautifully."                        |
|                      | It involves parsing, grammar rules, and syntactic tree generation. | Syntactic Tree: (S (NP (PRON She)) (VP (VERB sings)))   |
| Semantic Analysis    | Analysis of the meaning and interpretation of the sentence. | Sentence: "The cat is on the mat."                        |
|                      | It involves word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling. | Semantic Roles: [AGENT: The cat, THEME: on the mat]     |
| Discourse Integration | Analysis of the relationships between sentences or utterances. | Text: "He went to the store. He bought some groceries." |
|                      | It involves resolving references, anaphora, and maintaining discourse coherence. | Coreference: [He -> He]                                 |
| Pragmatic Analysis   | Analysis of the meaning in context and speaker intentions.  | Sentence: "Could you please pass the salt?"               |
|                      | It involves speech acts, implicatures, and contextual understanding. | Pragmatic Interpretation: Request for the salt.         |

These stages represent a typical pipeline in NLP where the text undergoes various analyses to extract information and understand its structure, meaning, and context. Each stage plays a crucial role in building a deeper understanding of the text and enables NLP applications to perform tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more.
