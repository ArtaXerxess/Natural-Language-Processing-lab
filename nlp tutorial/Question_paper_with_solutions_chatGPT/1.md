Lexical ambiguity is the potential for multiple interpretations of spoken or written language that renders it difficult or impossible to understand without some additional information.

Syntactic Ambiguity represents sentences that can be parsed in multiple syntactical forms.

|------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition       | Arises due to the structure or arrangement of words in a sentence. | Arises due to the presence of multiple meanings for a single word. |
| Cause            | Ambiguity is caused by the sentence structure or grammar. | Ambiguity is caused by the multiple meanings of a single word. |
| Nature           | Involves different interpretations of the same sentence structure. | Involves different interpretations of a specific word within a sentence. |
| Resolution       | Resolved by analyzing the sentence structure or by considering the context. | Resolved by considering the context or through the use of additional information. |
| Example Sentence | "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana." | "I saw a man on a hill with a telescope."                  |
| Explanation      | In the example, "Time flies" can be interpreted as "Time flies (insects) enjoy an arrow (like a bird)" or "Time flies (passes quickly) as an arrow (a metaphor for speed)." | In the example, "man on a hill with a telescope" can be interpreted as "a man standing on a hill who has a telescope" or "a man standing on a hill using a telescope." |
| Analysis         | The ambiguity is resolved by understanding the syntax and the relationships between the words in the sentence. | The ambiguity is resolved by considering the different meanings of the specific word in context or by using additional information. |
| Common Causes    | Sentence structure, word order, punctuation, and grammar can contribute to syntactic ambiguity. | Multiple meanings, homophones, homonyms, and polysemy contribute to lexical ambiguity. |
| Importance       | Important for understanding the intended meaning of a sentence and avoiding miscommunication. | Important for disambiguating the intended meaning of a specific word within a sentence. |


# 1B what are affixes, explain types of affixes

Affixes are morphemes that are added to the beginning (prefixes) or end (suffixes) of a base word to create a new word or modify the meaning or function of the base word. They play a crucial role in word formation and can change the grammatical category (part of speech) or alter the meaning of the base word. There are several types of affixes:

1. Prefixes: Prefixes are affixes that are added to the beginning of a base word. They can change the meaning or create a new word. Examples include:
   - Un- (unhappy, undo)
   - Dis- (dislike, disconnect)
   - Pre- (preview, preheat)

2. Suffixes: Suffixes are affixes that are added to the end of a base word. They can change the grammatical category or meaning of the word. Examples include:
   - -ly (quickly, beautifully)
   - -able (comfortable, understandable)
   - -er (teacher, runner)

3. Infixes: Infixes are affixes that are inserted into the middle of a base word. They are relatively rare in English but are more common in certain languages. Examples are limited in English, but one example is the expletive infix "bloody" (abso-bloody-lutely).

4. Circumfixes: Circumfixes are affixes that surround a base word, with one part added to the beginning and another part added to the end. They are also less common in English. Examples include:
   - En- + -ed (enlightened, enlivened)
   - Ge- + -ing (germinating, gesturing)

5. Interfixes: Interfixes are elements that occur between morphemes, but they do not change the meaning of the base word. They are relatively uncommon in English. For example, in the word "ham-burger," the interfix "-burg-" separates the base words "ham" and "-er."

6. Combining Forms: Combining forms are affixes used in the formation of compound words, often derived from Latin or Greek roots. They can be either prefixes or suffixes. Examples include:
   - Bio- (biology, biography)
   - Geo- (geology, geography)
   - Micro- (microscope, microbiology)

It's important to note that not all languages use affixes in the same way or to the same extent. The types and functions of affixes can vary across languages.

# 1C Describe openclass words and closedclass words in english with examples

In linguistics, words in a language are categorized into different classes based on their grammatical and semantic characteristics. One common way of classifying words is by dividing them into open class and closed class words.

1. Open Class Words:
Open class words, also known as content words, are words that have the ability to add new members and expand their category. They typically include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Open class words are relatively flexible and can easily accommodate new additions to the language. They tend to carry more meaning and play a central role in conveying information. Here are some examples:

- Nouns: dog, table, book
- Verbs: run, eat, speak
- Adjectives: happy, tall, blue
- Adverbs: quickly, carefully, very

2. Closed Class Words:
Closed class words, also known as function words, are words that have a limited number of members and do not readily accept new additions. They are considered more stable and less likely to change over time. Closed class words include pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, and certain adverbs. They serve grammatical functions and provide structure to sentences. Examples of closed class words are:

- Pronouns: I, you, he, she
- Conjunctions: and, but, or
- Prepositions: in, on, at
- Articles: a, an, the

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the concept of open class and closed class words is utilized to understand and process language. Open class words are often considered more important for tasks like information extraction, sentiment analysis, and text generation because they carry substantial semantic content. On the other hand, closed class words help establish the syntactic structure of sentences and aid in tasks such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and grammar checking.

NLP models and algorithms leverage the knowledge of open class and closed class words to analyze and process text. For instance, part-of-speech tagging algorithms assign appropriate tags to words in a sentence based on their grammatical role. This helps in understanding the syntactic structure and disambiguating word meanings. The distinction between open class and closed class words assists in designing language models and developing computational systems that can handle various linguistic tasks.
